      <h1 class="cocogoose">ROLAND GARROS 2023 <br>
            THE MAIN TENNIS EVENT IN THE SEASON IS COMING
            IN MAY 2023
      </h1>
      <p class="lato">The French Open, also known as Roland Garros, is one of the four 
            Grand Slam tournaments in tennis. The tournament is named after Roland Garros, 
            a French aviator and World War I hero. The tournament was first held in 1891 and 
            was open only to French tennis players. In 1925, the tournament became open to 
            international players and was held at the Stade Roland Garros, which is located in
             the 16th arrondissement of Paris. Over the years, the tournament has changed in many ways. 
             In 2019, floodlights were added so that games could be played in the evening.
          <br> <br>
          In the 1980s, the tournament saw the emergence of several legendary players, 
          such as Ivan Lendl and Chris Evert, who won multiple titles at the tournament. 
          However, it was in the 2000s that a new era of dominance began with the 
          emergence of one of the greatest players of all time, Rafael Nadal. Nadal has 
          won a record 13 French Open titles, and his dominance on the clay courts of 
          Roland Garros is unmatched. He has won the tournament almost every year since 
          his first win in 2005, except for a few years when he was either injured or 
          unable to compete. Nadal’s success at the tournament has solidified his place 
          in tennis history and has made him a household name around the world. His rivalry 
          with Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic has also added to the tournament’s appeal, 
          making it a highly anticipated event every year.
